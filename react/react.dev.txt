javascript library for creating user interfaces. UI is build from small units like button textfiled header footer .
React lets you combine them with reusable nested components


jsx synthatic extention for javascritp to write html like markput inside  of a function

why we have to wrap multiple elements in a single tag like div or fragment
jsx look like html but under the hood it is converted to javascript objects and a function cannot return two objects 


Keys in React help it keep track of items in a list. When items are added, removed, or moved, React uses the keys to know which item is which, so it can update the screen efficiently.

Think of keys like name tags on items â€” if each item has a unique name, React can quickly figure out what changed without redoing everything.
